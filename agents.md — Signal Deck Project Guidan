# agents.md — Signal Deck Project Guidance

This file explains the **intent, philosophy, and working style** of the Signal Deck project for human and AI contributors.

If you are an LMM agent, **read this file before writing any code.**

For full details see:

👉 **`docs/design.md` — Signal Deck Phased Implementation Plan**

# Project Name

**Signal Deck**

Tagline ideas:

* *The oscilloscope for Home Assistant*
* *Observe your home*
* *Signals before booleans*

Signal Deck is a **Home Assistant Lovelace card** that embeds a safe Python-like REPL (via WASM) to explore, debug, and visualise Home Assistant state.

It is inspired by:

* Jupyter notebooks
* ipywidgets
* Observability dashboards
* Retro terminal tools
* Robin Ridler’s Home Assistant observability work

---

# What Signal Deck IS

Signal Deck is:

• A safe Python shell inside Lovelace
• A debugging and observability tool
• A way for LLMs to generate snippets you can run
• A rich display system for HA state
• A mini-automation control surface (safe + gated)
• An event-driven diagnostics instrument

It should feel like:

👉 an oscilloscope
👉 a notebook
👉 a debugging console
👉 an observability dashboard

---

# What Signal Deck is NOT

Signal Deck is NOT:

• Remote code execution
• A full automation engine
• A backend integration
• A replacement for HA automations
• A generic Python environment

Safety and clarity are more important than power.

# Core Design Principles

1. **Safe by default**

   * Read-only state access
   * Service calls require explicit arming
   * No filesystem or network access

2. **Small, opinionated API**

   * `ha.state()`
   * `ha.states()`
   * `ha.match()`
   * `ha.history()`
   * `ui.entity()`, `ui.table()`, `ui.ts()` etc.

3. **LLM-friendly output**

   * Tables
   * JSON
   * ASCII timelines
   * Copy-paste debug reports

4. **Observability first**

   * Explain why things changed
   * Correlate signals
   * Show timelines
   * Prefer signals over booleans

5. **Declarative configuration**

   * Startup scripts
   * Scheduled snippets
   * Event-triggered snippets
   * Bundles

6. **Runs entirely in Lovelace**

   * Uses HA WebSocket API
   * No backend required

---

# Visual Style (Important!)

Signal Deck should feel **awesome and nerdy**.

Use:

• **Iosevka Nerd Font** (primary font)
• Monospace layouts
• Nerd Font glyphs
• Coloured terminal-style output
• ASCII tables and timelines
• Dense observability dashboards

Think:

👉 htop
👉 retro oscilloscope
👉 Winamp visualiser
👉 network monitoring consoles

The UI should make engineers smile.

---

# Example UI Goals

* Inline entity displays
* ASCII timeline of binary sensors
* ECharts graphs for history/statistics
* Tables with sparkline columns
* Nerd-font icons for signals
* “Explain this flip” panels

---

# Development Phases

Signal Deck is built in phases.

Agents should prioritise:

1. MVP shell
2. Rich display
3. History + ECharts
4. Event/scheduled snippets
5. Widgets
6. Debugging toolkit
7. Packaging

See full plan:

👉 **`docs/design.md`**

# Behaviour Guidelines for Agents

When contributing:

• Prefer clarity over cleverness
• Keep API minimal
• Add safety checks
• Make output readable in tables
• Use monospace formatting
• Use Nerd Font icons where helpful
• Do not add backend dependencies unless explicitly requested
• Do not expand scope into full automation engine

When unsure, optimise for:

👉 debugging presence logic
👉 understanding “why did this happen?”

These are the primary user needs.

---

# Tone of the Project

Signal Deck should feel like:

• a professional engineering instrument
• fun and nerdy
• deeply technical
• precise and explainable

It is part of a broader ecosystem of observability work (Accumulator, dashboards, etc.).
